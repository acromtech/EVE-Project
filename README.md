# EVE : A new search engine

## What's EVE ?
EVE is a search engine able to processing textual, photographic and sound data. 

## How this project ?
This project has produced as part of the "Projet Fil Rouge (PFR)" during the 1st year of training at the UPSSITECH engineering school in Toulouse. Federated by Isabelle FERRANE, Julien PINQUIER and Julien VANDERSTRAETEN. It allows students to address many technical, organizational and professional aspects through a transversal project to implement severals scientific and technical skills of the SRI specialty such as computer science, content analysis (audio, image and text), interaction, and robotics.
It also allows to put into practice different project management skills by connecting a client (here Julien PINQUIER) and our project team.

## Our vision
Perfect search engines of tomorrow to make them more ergonomic and intuitive in order to integrate them into future home automation and robotics equipment.

## Our Team
UPSSIWEB is a french 5 members team :

* __Emilien VESIN__ :
  * **Role** : Integrator, backend developer
  * **Work on** : [general menu](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/menu) and [indexing and search for sound data](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/audio).
  * **Who am I ?** : In 2020 I obtained my scientific baccalaureate option sciences of engineering specialty physics chemistry. Then I continued my training in DUT GEII in Toulouse where I could deepen my skills in C language as well as in organization through different projects. My end-of-year internship in a company also allowed me to develop my work independently and as a team.

* __Bastien LALANNE__ :
  * **Role** : Backend developer
  * **Work on** : [admin menu](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/menu), [indexing and search for sound data](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/audio), [HMI](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/main/PFR_PHASE_2/IHM).
  * **Who am I ?** : Thanks to my DUT GEII, I was able to acquire technical skills in the fields of electronics and computer science, but also more transversal skills such as teamwork, organization or project management. I also have a solid knowledge of C. During my internship I was able to acquire autonomy, but also relational skills.

* __Flavie THIBAULT__ :
  * **Role** : Client Coordinator & Backend Developer
  * **Work on** : [indexing and searching for photographic data](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/image), [HMI](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/main/PFR_PHASE_2/IHM).
  * **Who am I ?** : After obtaining a baccalaureate STL specialty physics chemistry I returned to preparatory class at the TSI grandes écoles. These two years in CPGE allowed me to acquire a great work capacity. I have skills in mathematics, physics, algorithms and project management.

* __Andy DEGBEGNI__ :
  * **Role** : Backend Developer C
  * **Work on** : [search engine](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/main/PFR_PHASE_2/JAVA_C/PipeJAVAC/Moteur1), [indexing text data](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/texte) and [indexing photographic data](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/image).
  * **Who am I ?** : I followed a CPGE MPSI and I hold a license in computer science. I am therefore able to intervene on issues related to the analysis and modeling of problems, as well as on technical points in computer science. I have skills in procedural programming (C language) and object oriented programming (Python, Java, C++).

* __Alexis GIBERT__
  * **Role** : Project Manager and project Coordinator, JAVA-C Backend Developer
  * **Work on** : [virtual bus](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/main/PFR_PHASE_2/JAVA_C), [text data search](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/texte) and [photo data search](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/image) 
  * **Who am I ?** : Coming from a double training of BTS CPI and DUT GEII, I am able to work on technical points in mechanics, electronics and computer science. I have strong skills in embedded development (C), object-oriented development (Python) and project management.

* __Elio GENSON__ : 
  * **Role** : JAVA backend developer
  * **Work on** : [complex search](https://github.com/acromtech/PFR/tree/main/PFR_PHASE_2/JAVA_C/srcLib/src)
  * **Who am I ?** : After my STL baccalaureate, I decided to continue my studies with a BTS CIRA (Industrial Control and Automatic Regulation), which allowed me to develop skills in regulation, control and automation of processes. Subsequently, I joined the preparatory class ATS science option of the engineer of Déodat de Séverac, which allowed me to acquire a solid working capacity as well as other essential skills for the profession of engineer.
